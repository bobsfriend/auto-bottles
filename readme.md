# Auto Bottles

This is a chrome extension that will automatically get you bottles in ocean hero.
It is not very fast, but works well when you are away from the computer for a while.
I estimate about 200 bottles in 5 minutes.

**Using this doesn't help Ocean Hero. See this [faq article](https://oceanhero.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012009979-Can-I-generate-searches-with-bots-or-do-many-random-manual-searches-).**
